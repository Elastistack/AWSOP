# AWS Oriented Programming - AWSOP

AWS Oriented Programming is a core set of architectural design and development best practices that implement a native AWS-based application. By native we are referring to fully managed services such as S3, Lambda, SNS, Cognito and so forth. In contrast, a non-native application would include using virtualized instances inside of EC2 or on bare metal in your own data center that require that you host and manage the various running services yourself. Cases like these are what is known as a hybrid solution.

This sites primary focus is that of providing conceptual ideas, code and content that help capture the essence of what AWSOP represents. Over the coming weeks and months we will be building a native AWS reference application that highlights the various fully-managed services provided by AWS. When complete this application will be made available open source and documentation provided highlighting the architecture implemented and the services used in its development.
